%
% function linear_AOI_interpolation(frm,xycenter,radius)
%
% This function will integrate an aoi specified by the center xy 
% coordinates of the aoi (xycenter) and the aoi size (radius = 1/2 the
% length of one side).  When the aoi overlaps only a fraction of a 
% particular pixel, the integration will include that same fraction of
% the pixel value in the output sum.
%
% frm == image frame that contains the aoi that will be integrated
% xycenter  ==  [xcoordinate ycoordinate]  the x and y coordinates of the 
%            aoi center (integral numbers specify the center of a pixel,
%            half integers specify the edge of a pixel)
% radius  ==  when an aoi is m x m pixels in dimensions, the radius is
%            defined as m/2, or half the length (in pixels) of one side of
%            the aoi.  e.g. a 6 x 6 pixel has a radius of 3 and a 7 x 7 aoi
%            has a radius of 3.5

            % Define a range of pixels that more than encompases the entire
            % aoi.  We will integrate only over this limited pixel range.
